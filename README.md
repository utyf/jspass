jspass
======

Simple JS password-manager. 
Doesn't store anything on server, just creates passwords using some info about destination. 

First text input is "target" word (eg. "gmail") 
Second is master-password - your long and secure main password

From this data new password is generated.

So you can remember only one master-password.
